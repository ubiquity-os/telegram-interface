# Resilience and UX Improvements

## Overview
Implemented several improvements to make the Telegram bot more resilient and provide better user experience with human-like processing messages.

## Key Improvements

### 1. MCP Settings Resilience
- **File**: `src/services/mcp-hub.ts`
- **Change**: Made MCP settings file optional
- **Benefit**: Bot continues to work even if `mcp-settings.json` is missing
- **Behavior**: Logs "MCP settings file not found" and continues with core tools only

### 2. Human-like Processing Messages
- **File**: `src/services/processing-messages.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Random processing messages with emojis
  - Tool-specific messages (weather, search, followup)
  - Long processing messages for delays
  - Retry attempt messages

### 3. Immediate User Feedback
- **Files**: `src/handlers/message.ts`, `src/handlers/callback-query.ts`
- **Behavior**:
  1. Sends processing message immediately (e.g., "Working on it! 🤔")
  2. Updates to "taking longer" message after 5 seconds
  3. Deletes processing message when response is ready
  4. Shows final response

### 4. Basic MCP Configuration
- **File**: `mcp-settings.json`
- **Purpose**: Provides minimal configuration for testing
- **Content**: Includes weather server configuration

## Processing Message Examples

### General Messages
- "Working on it! 🤔"
- "Just a moment... ⏳"
- "Let me think about that... 💭"
- "On it! 🚀"
- "Hang tight! 🎯"

### Tool-Specific Messages
- **Weather**: "Checking the weather... ☁️"
- **Search**: "Looking it up... 📚"
- **Followup**: "I have a question for you... 🤔"

### Long Processing Messages
- "This is taking a bit longer than expected... 🕐"
- "Still working on it, thanks for your patience! 🙏"
- "Taking a little extra time to get this right... ✨"

### Retry Messages
- "Let me try that again... (attempt 2) 🔄"
- "Hmm, let me rethink this... (attempt 3) 💭"

## User Experience Flow

1. **User sends message**
2. **Bot immediately responds**: "Working on it! 🤔"
3. **If processing takes > 5 seconds**: Updates to "This is taking a bit longer... 🕐"
4. **When ready**: Deletes processing message and shows actual response
5. **If using inline keyboard**: Shows buttons for selection
6. **On button click**: Shows "Just a moment... ⏳" while processing selection

## Benefits

1. **No Silent Failures**: Bot works even without MCP settings
2. **Immediate Feedback**: Users know their message was received
3. **Human Touch**: Friendly, varied messages with emojis
4. **Transparency**: Shows when processing is taking longer
5. **Clean UI**: Processing messages are deleted when done

## Error Handling

- MCP settings missing → Continue with core tools
- Processing timeout → Show "taking longer" message
- Message deletion fails → Log error and continue
- Callback query errors → Show user-friendly error message

## Testing

Run the processing messages test:
```bash
deno run --allow-read tests/test-processing-messages.ts
```

This shows various processing messages and ensures randomization works correctly.
