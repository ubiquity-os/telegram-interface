# Project Brief: Telegram Interface Bot

## Overview

A sophisticated Telegram bot designed for Deno Deploy that integrates with multiple MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to provide AI-powered conversational experiences. The bot serves as an intelligent interface between Telegram users and various external tools and services.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Goals
1. **Intelligent Conversations**: Provide AI-powered responses using OpenRouter integration with DeepSeek models
2. **Tool Integration**: Connect with MCP servers to extend bot capabilities (weather, file access, search, etc.)
3. **Scalable Architecture**: Support high-throughput message processing with performance optimizations
4. **Production Ready**: Robust error handling, monitoring, and deployment automation

### Key Features
- **AI-Powered Chat**: Natural language conversations using LLM services
- **MCP Tool Calling**: Dynamic integration with external MCP servers for enhanced capabilities
- **Message Queue System**: Priority-based message processing with worker pools
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient MCP server connection management with health checks
- **Context Caching**: LRU cache with TTL for improved response times
- **Conversation Persistence**: Long-term conversation history using Deno KV
- **Dual Deployment**: Separate production and preview environments

### Technical Requirements
- **Runtime**: Deno Deploy (serverless edge computing)
- **Framework**: Grammy (Telegram bot framework)
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict typing
- **Storage**: Deno KV for conversation persistence and caching
- **AI Service**: OpenRouter API integration
- **Protocol**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) for external integrations

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅
- Basic bot setup with Grammy framework
- Telegram webhook integration
- Health check endpoints
- CI/CD deployment pipeline

### Phase 2: Core Intelligence ✅
- OpenRouter LLM integration
- Basic conversation handling
- Message preprocessing and response generation
- Error handling and logging

### Phase 3: Performance and Scaling ✅
- Message queue system with priority processing
- MCP connection pool with health checks and circuit breaker
- Context caching layer with LRU implementation
- Complete service integration and TypeScript fixes

### Phase 4: Testing and Monitoring (Next)
- Comprehensive test suite
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking and analytics
- Production deployment optimization

## Success Criteria

### Phase 3 Completion (Current Status)
- ✅ All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- ✅ Message queue system operational with worker pools
- ✅ Connection pool managing MCP server connections
- ✅ Context caching reducing response latency
- ✅ All services properly integrated and tested
- ✅ Production-ready architecture

### Phase 4 Goals
- Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- Performance metrics and monitoring
- Production deployment documentation
- User acceptance testing

## Scope and Boundaries

### In Scope
- Telegram bot conversation handling
- MCP server integration
- AI-powered responses
- Performance optimization
- Production deployment

### Out of Scope
- Custom MCP server development
- Telegram channel management
- Multi-language support (English only)
- Voice/media message processing

## Stakeholders
